## Problem Statement ##

You are given a tree consisting of `n` nodes.

Your task is to determine for each node the sum of the distances from the node to all other nodes.

## Input ##

The first input line contains an integer n: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered `1, 2, …, n`.

Then there are `n−1` lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers `a` and `b`: there is an edge between nodes `a` and `b`.

## Output ##

Print `n` integers: for each node `1,2,…,n` the sum of the distances.

### Constraints ###

`1 ≤ n ≤ 2`<sup>`105`</sup>

`1 ≤ a, b ≤ n`
